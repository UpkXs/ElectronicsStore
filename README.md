# Electronics Store

The E-Store app is a platform for small purchases. Allows users online, through a mobile application, 
to form a purchase order, choose a method of payment and delivery of the order, pay for the order.

### The functionality I'm going to implement in this project:
* Login and Registration;
* Show all available products on the platform;
* Sorting products by category;
* Select the desired number of products;
* Add to cart or pay immediately;

To implement this functionality, I used `Java`, for the database `Firebase` and other tools.
